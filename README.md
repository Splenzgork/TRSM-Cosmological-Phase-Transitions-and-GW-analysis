# TRSM Cosmological Phase Transitions and Gravitational Waves

Investigation of the Two-Real-Singlet Model (TRSM) in the context of cosmological phase transitions and the detectability of the resulting gravitational wave signals.

## 🔬 Scientific Motivation

First-order phase transitions in extensions of the Standard Model can generate observable gravitational wave signals. The TRSM provides a well-motivated framework to explore this phenomenon. This project investigates:

- The scalar potential structure of the TRSM
- Thermal phase transition dynamics
- Nucleation and completion conditions
- Gravitational wave spectra
- Detectability by the planned GW observatory LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)
