## 🔬 Scientific Motivation

First-order phase transitions in extensions of the Standard Model can generate observable gravitational wave signals. The TRSM provides a well-motivated framework to explore this phenomenon. This project investigates:

- The effective potential structure of the TRSM
- Thermal phase transition dynamics and phase structure of a given model
- Phase transition parameters
- Gravitational wave spectra
- Detectability by the planned GW observatory LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)

## Software used

This project uses the **CosmoTransitions** package by Carroll L. Wainwright (2011):

*CosmoTransitions: Computing Cosmological Phase Transition Temperatures and Bubble Profiles with Multiple Fields*.
